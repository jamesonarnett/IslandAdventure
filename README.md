A pokemon-esque style game.

A breath of fresh air while staying hopeful on future employment. While this isnt using the latest framework, or any catchy buzzwords, its great vanilla practice and has been a ton of fun.

Tiled (program to make the map image) is an absolute treat, and extraordinarily easy to use.
